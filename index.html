        // Understanding The Problem
        // Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
        // However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
        // For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

        // When a user inputs a number
        let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

        // Loop from 1 to the entered number
        // We declare a variable i and assign it 1: the initial value of the variable i in our loop 
        // ( NOTE : Most of the time, programmers find themselves looping from 0. Due to the needs of our program, we're starting from 1).
        // The second clause i <= answer is our condition. We want to loop until i is greater than answer. 
        // The third clause i++, tells our loop to increment i by 1 every iteration. As a result, if the user inputs 10, this loop would print numbers 1 - 10 to the console.
        for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
            if (i %
                3 === 0 && i %
                5 === 0) {
                // If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
                console.log('FizzBuzz');
            } else if (i %
                3 === 0) {
                // If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
                console.log('Fizz');
            } else if (i %
                5 === 0) {
                // If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
                console.log('Buzz');
            } else {
                console.log(i);
                // Otherwise print the current number
            }
        }
